<h2>Snippy</h2>
<p>Snippy is the design solution for scissor packaging that will often require scissors to open their blister packages. It contains a perforation line (it can also be torn with leverage from a pen for those with hand dexterities) that will cause no injuries when opened. The package contains only one spot of glue and can be recycled. This concept received a Commendation in the 2012 Southern Cross Packaging Design Awards.</p>
