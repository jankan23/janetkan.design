<h2>Chevrolet Corvette Book Redesign</h2>
<p>The ‘Chevrolet Corvette – the First Generation’ is a publication redesign that focuses on the brand status and quality. The book contains a renewed layout and a Perspex cover etched with the logo to reflect the sleek look of the cars. It is all black to show no emotive colours and to emphasize the contrast of gloss and matte. Layouts are inviting and maximizes legibility, with branding elements such as the pinstripes carried throughout the spreads.</p>
