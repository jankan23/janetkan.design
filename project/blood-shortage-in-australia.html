	<h2>Blood Shortage in Australia (Red Cross)</h2>
	<p>Australia has always been short of blood. This design strategy contains extensive research into the issue and aims to increase the rate of blood donations in Australia by playing with blood traits and personality types. The strategy is an effective and fun way of getting people to talk about their blood types and ultimately, donate. Information is presented clearly with the use of infographics within this proposal document, which outlines the entire campaign and design assets required.</p>
